### Well, I'm struggling to find the good split sign, so I did it like this:
------
- Requests that would returns new pair of access and refresh token and called it **Mutation** (mutating tokens)
- Request that wouldn't do the previous thing (would not update tokens) - **Query**
------
### The split sign is pretty strange but it's okay if you noticed about it.
